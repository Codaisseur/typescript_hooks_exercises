# React hooks exercise bank

This is just a bunch of custom hooks that you can practice on.

Each of the hooks has a test file. You can run the tests using `npm run test` (or `yarn run test` if you prefer). By default, all the tests are skipped, like so:

```js
test.skip("some case", () => {
  // ...
});
```

You've solved an exercise if you've been able to make the hook work for each test case, which you can "unskip" by just removing the `.skip` part:

```js
test("some case", () => {
  // ...
});
```

Solutions for each of the exercises can be found in the Pull Requests.
